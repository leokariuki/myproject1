# IMDb Movie Analysis Project  

## Project Overview  
This was my first project as a data scientist, focused on analyzing movie data from IMDb to identify the top-selling movies alongside their runtime. The project also served as a way to test and improve my SQL skills.  

## Objectives  
- Analyze IMDb data to determine top-grossing movies.  
- Explore the relationship between movie runtime and revenue.  
- Practice SQL querying techniques for data extraction and analysis.  

## Technologies Used  
- **SQL** (for data extraction and analysis)  
- **Python** (for additional data processing and visualization)  
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for visualizing trends)  

## Data Source  
The dataset was sourced from IMDb, containing movie details such as title, release year, runtime, revenue, and ratings.  

## Key Findings  
- The highest-grossing movies often had runtimes ranging between 100 and 130 minutes.    
- Certain genres consistently appeared among the top earners.
